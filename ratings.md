Whenever we search for a food item, the app shows the most rated/popular restraunt for the paticular item that is ordered. 
It does it based on Ranking with priotiry (Lowest number meaning the highest priority) and sorting algorithms.

- **Quick Sort**: Quick sort is also known as a “partition sort.” This sorting algorithm is faster than the previous algorithms because this algorithm uses the concept of divide and conquer. First, we decide on a pivot element. We then find the correct index for this pivot position and divide the array into two subarrays. One subarray will contain elements that are lesser than our pivot, and the other subarray will contain elements that are greater than our pivot. We then recursively call these two sub-arrays, and the process goes on until we can’t further divide the array[[4](https://builtin.com/machine-learning/fastest-sorting-algorithm)].

- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array. In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted[[5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)].
