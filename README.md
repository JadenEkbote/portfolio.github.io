#### Note:

### Introduction
Twitch started in June 2011 as a spin-off of Justin.tv, a general-interest streaming platform. Created by Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, Twitch was designed to focus specifically on video game live streaming. Its immediate popularity among gamers led to rapid growth, making it a dominant force in the live streaming industry. In 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million, further boosting its expansion and integration with other Amazon services.

Twitch is now a leading platform for live streaming, primarily centered around video games, but it has diversified to include various other content categories like music, creative arts, and "in real life" (IRL) streams. The platform is known for its interactive chat feature, allowing real-time engagement between streamers and viewers, fostering a vibrant community. Key features include channel subscriptions, Bits for cheering, custom emotes, and the ability to save broadcasts as Videos on Demand (VODs). Twitch has become a central hub for gaming culture and live content creation, influencing how audiences consume entertainment online.
