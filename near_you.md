k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. K-dimensional is that which concerns exactly k orthogonal axes or a space of any number of dimensions.[1] k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as:

Searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches) &
Creating point clouds.
k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees.

For geospatial restaurant detection, k-d trees are effective due to their efficient organization of spatial data, enabling rapid querying and proximity searches. By recursively partitioning the data space into nested half-spaces, k-d trees allow for quick location-based queries and nearest neighbor searches, which are essential for identifying nearby restaurants within a given range. Their adaptability to multidimensional data, such as coordinates, ensures optimal performance in handling large datasets, making them a robust choice for applications in geographic information systems (GIS) and location-based services.
