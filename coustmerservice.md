Coustmer Service plays outmost importance in maintaining an online food delivery system. Having a good coustmer service in peak service times whenever needed is extermely important for mainting a good feedback from the coustmers.

Manging the coustmers who have issues lined up in queue is essential at making sure that the issue is resolved in the quickest possible time. Priority Queues are one such functinality that help in solving this coustmer service problem for EatSure.

A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack abstract data type. Each element in a priority queue has an associated priority. In a priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority. While priority queues are often implemented using heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract data type like a list or a map; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or with an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or another method such as an ordered array [9].

### Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements. 

### Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements.
