EatSure can optimize their delivery charges by utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most cost-effective routes for their deliveries. In this context, each node in the graph represents a location, such as a restaurant or a customer's address, and each edge between nodes represents a road segment with an associated delivery cost. By applying Dijkstra's algorithm, EatSure can calculate the shortest path from the restaurant to the customer's location, ensuring that the delivery is made using the least expensive route available. This approach not only minimizes the delivery cost but also helps in improving the efficiency of the delivery process, reducing delivery times and enhancing overall customer satisfaction. By continuously updating the graph with real-time traffic data and road conditions, EatSure can dynamically adjust delivery routes to always offer the most cost-effective and timely delivery service.

### Time Complexity: O(V^2), Where V is the number of vertices.

### Space Complexity: O(E + V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
