Tracking your food order in real time when the dleivery partner is delivering it to your destination is one of the most important features that the online food delivery platform provides. A* search is one of the pathfinding algorithms that can be utilised for finding the shortest path between the delivery partner and the users destination.

The A* search algorithm is an algorithm that focuses on optimal pathfinding, using heuristic evaluation and cost-effective analysis. Combining elements of graph theory and computational intelligence, A* navigates the whole structre by prioritizing nodes based on a blend of heuristic estimates and past cost metrics, ensuring minimal computational overhead while maximizing solution accuracy. Its adaptability to various domains, from robotics and logistics to software engineering, underscores its versatility and reliability in real-time decision-making scenarios, epitomizing a fusion of algorithmic efficiency and engineering ingenuity.
