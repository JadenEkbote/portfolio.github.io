EatSure can solve the delivery charge for thier orders by using dijkistras algorithm where the cost form each node can act as the delivery cost between that road segments.


### Time Complexity: O(V^2), Where V is the number of vertices.

### Space Complexity: O(E + V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
