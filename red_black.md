Each Restuarnt will have its own menu and all the ratings with it. 
The ability to sort menu items based on their type, or the ratings of the resturant are maintained using Red-black trees.

Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure, but their performance can suffer if the tree becomes unbalanced. Red Black Trees are a type of balanced binary search tree that use a set of rules to maintain balance, ensuring logarithmic time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, regardless of the initial shape of the tree. Red Black Trees are self-balancing, using a simple color-coding scheme to adjust the tree after each modification.[[6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-red-black-tree/)]
